# 📌 PalindromeCheckerApp

## 🎯 Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a simple Java application that checks whether a given string is a palindrome or not.
This project also demonstrates the use of Git and GitHub for version control, branch creation, file staging, and repository management using IntelliJ IDEA.

## 🔁 Project Flow / Procedure

### Step 1: Project Setup

* Opened **Documents** folder in the system.
* Created a new folder named with my **Full Roll Number**.

### Step 2: GitHub Repository Creation

* Created a new repository in GitHub.
* Repository Name: **PalindromeCheckerApp**
* Enabled **README file (Mandatory)**.
* Copied the repository link.

### Step 3: Clone Repository

* Opened Command Prompt from the folder location.

* Used the following command:

  git clone repository_link

* The repository was successfully cloned to the local system.

### Step 4: Open Project in IntelliJ

* Opened IntelliJ IDEA.
* Closed existing project.
* Clicked **Open** and selected the cloned repository folder.

### Step 5: Create Module

* Right-clicked on the project folder.
* Created a new module named **App**.

### Step 6: Create Java Class

* Inside the `src` folder, created a new Java class:

  **PalindromeCheckerApp.java**

### Step 7: Check Git Status

* Opened Terminal in IntelliJ.

* Used:

  git status

* Checked current branch and untracked files.

### Step 8: Create New Branch

* Created a new branch using:

  git checkout -b branch_name

* Verified branch using:

  git branch

### Step 9: Implement Use Case Logic

* Wrote the palindrome checking logic inside:

  PalindromeCheckerApp.java

### Step 10: Git File Management

* Added files using:

  git add .

* Unstaged files using:

  git restore --staged .

* Added only the required file:

  git add App/src/PalindromeCheckerApp.java

## 💡 Use Case

The application performs the following:

1. Accepts a string input from the user.
2. Reverses the input string.
3. Compares the original string with the reversed string.
4. Displays:

    * "It is a Palindrome" if both are equal.
    * "It is Not a Palindrome" otherwise.
